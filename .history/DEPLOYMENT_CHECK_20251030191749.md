# Deployment & Session Fix

## Two Issues Fixed:

### 1. ✅ Promise Rejection Handler Added
The "No matching key" error was happening in a Promise, so our window error handler couldn't catch it. Now we catch **both** error types and auto-clear expired sessions!

### 2. ⏰ Contract Still Indexing (404)
Your contract was deployed **~10 minutes ago** but Mirror Node can take **5-10 minutes** to fully index new contracts.

---

## What You Need To Do:

### Step 1: Clear Session Manually
Run this in browser console **RIGHT NOW**:
```javascript
// Clear all WalletConnect sessions
Object.keys(localStorage).forEach(key => {
  if (key.startsWith('wc@2:') || key.includes('hashconnect')) {
    localStorage.removeItem(key);
  }
});
console.log('✅ Sessions cleared!');
location.reload();
```

### Step 2: Check Contract on HashScan
Open this link to verify your contract exists:
**https://hashscan.io/testnet/contract/0xb4d36AA7305e6fC1a9bDCa236274cCd130D1382b**

You should see:
- Contract creation transaction
- Your deployer address
- Contract bytecode

### Step 3: Wait for Indexing (~5 more minutes)
Check if Mirror Node has indexed it:
```javascript
fetch('https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/contracts/0xb4d36AA7305e6fC1a9bDCa236274cCd130D1382b')
  .then(r => r.ok ? console.log('✅ INDEXED!') : console.log('⏰ Not yet, Status:', r.status));
```

### Step 4: Once Indexed, Test the Game
1. Refresh page
2. Connect wallet (fresh session)
3. Play and submit score
4. Should work with NO errors!

---

## What We Fixed:

1. **Promise Rejection Handler**: Now catches async "No matching key" errors
2. **Auto-Clear & Reload**: Automatically clears expired sessions and prompts reconnect
3. **Immediate Return**: Transaction returns right after HashPack approval (no hanging)

---

## Expected Flow:

```
User plays game → Submits score
  ↓
Transaction sent to HashPack
  ↓
User approves in HashPack
  ↓
✅ Loading stops IMMEDIATELY
  ↓
Console: "✅ Transaction submitted to network"
  ↓
(3 seconds later)
  ↓
Console: "🔍 Verifying data was saved..."
  ↓
If 404: "⏰ Contract not indexed yet" (wait)
If 200: "✅ Data successfully saved!" (works!)
```

---

## Try This:
1. Clear session (step 1 above)
2. **Wait 5 more minutes** for indexing
3. Test the game
4. Report what you see!
