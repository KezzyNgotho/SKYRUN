# 🏆 Complete Blockchain Stats Integration

## ✅ What's Now Saved on the Blockchain

Your game now tracks **ALL** your stats on the Hedera blockchain, not just locally!

### Blockchain Stats Tracked:

| Stat | Stored On | Updates When |
|------|-----------|--------------|
| **🪙 Tokens Earned** | Blockchain ✅ | After each score submission |
| **🏆 High Score** | Blockchain ✅ | After each score submission |
| **🎮 Games Played** | Blockchain ✅ | After each score submission |
| **📊 Total Score** | Blockchain ✅ | After each score submission |
| **⭐ Player Level** | Blockchain ✅ | Auto-calculated from total score |
| **❤️ Lives Available** | Blockchain ✅ | After buying/using lifelines |
| **🛒 Lifelines Purchased** | Blockchain ✅ | After buying lifelines |

**Everything is permanent and cannot be lost!** 🔒

## 🎮 How the Smart Contract Tracks Your Stats

### When You Submit a Score:

The smart contract automatically:

1. **Increments Games Played** (`totalGamesPlayed++`)
2. **Adds to Total Score** (`totalScore += yourScore`)
3. **Updates High Score** (if `yourScore > highScore`)
4. **Calculates Tokens** (`tokens = score / 100`)
5. **Updates Level** (`level = totalScore / 1000 + 1`)
6. **Saves Everything** to blockchain

```solidity
function submitGameScore(uint256 score) external {
    Stats storage s = userStats[msg.sender];
    s.totalGamesPlayed += 1;
    s.totalScore += score;
    if (score > s.highScore) s.highScore = score;
    uint256 tokensToMint = score / 100;
    s.tokensEarned += tokensToMint;
    s.level = (s.totalScore / 1000) + 1;
}
```

## 🔄 What Gets Synced to Your UI

### Main Menu Stats:

**Before (Local Only):**
```
High Score: 1,500 (from localStorage)
Total Coins: 800 (from localStorage)
Games Played: 15 (from localStorage)
```

**After (Blockchain):**
```
High Score: 0 (from blockchain - NEW CONTRACT!)
Total Coins: 0 (from blockchain - NEW CONTRACT!)
Games Played: 0 (from blockchain - NEW CONTRACT!)
```

*Note: It's 0 because we deployed a NEW contract. Play to earn stats on the fixed contract!*

## 🎮 Testing Your New Stats System

### Step 1: Refresh Browser
```
Ctrl + Shift + R (hard refresh)
```

### Step 2: Connect Wallet
- Click "Connect Wallet"
- Approve in HashPack
- Wait 1-2 seconds for auto-sync

### Step 3: Check Initial Stats
Open console (F12) and run:
```javascript
await syncBlockchainStats()
```

You should see:
```
📊 Blockchain Stats:
  🪙 Tokens: 0
  ❤️ Lives: 0
  🏆 High Score: 0
  🎮 Games Played: 0
  📊 Total Score: 0
  ⭐ Level: 1
```

Your main menu should match these values!

### Step 4: Play and Submit Score
1. Play the game
2. Score **2,500 points**
3. Submit your score
4. Wait 2-3 seconds for auto-sync

### Step 5: Verify All Stats Updated
Run again:
```javascript
await syncBlockchainStats()
```

You should now see:
```
📊 Blockchain Stats:
  🪙 Tokens: 25 (2500 / 100)
  ❤️ Lives: 0
  🏆 High Score: 2500
  🎮 Games Played: 1
  📊 Total Score: 2500
  ⭐ Level: 3 ((2500 / 1000) + 1)
```

And your main menu should show:
- **High Score:** 2,500 ✅
- **Total Coins:** 25 ✅
- **Games Played:** 1 ✅

### Step 6: Play Again (Test Accumulation)
1. Play another game
2. Score **1,500 points**
3. Submit your score
4. Wait for auto-sync

Now you should see:
```
📊 Blockchain Stats:
  🪙 Tokens: 40 (2500 + 1500 = 4000 / 100)
  ❤️ Lives: 0
  🏆 High Score: 2500 (didn't beat it)
  🎮 Games Played: 2 (incremented!)
  📊 Total Score: 4000 (2500 + 1500)
  ⭐ Level: 5 ((4000 / 1000) + 1)
```

### Step 7: Buy a Lifeline (Test Token Spending)
1. Click "Buy Life"
2. Approve transaction
3. Wait for auto-sync

Now you should see:
```
📊 Blockchain Stats:
  🪙 Tokens: 30 (40 - 10 = 30)
  ❤️ Lives: 1
  🏆 High Score: 2500
  🎮 Games Played: 2
  📊 Total Score: 4000
  ⭐ Level: 5
```

Your coins in the UI should update to **30**!

## 🔧 Manual Commands

### Check All Stats:
```javascript
await syncBlockchainStats()
```

### Get Raw Blockchain Data:
```javascript
const stats = await window.reactWalletFunctions.getUserStats()
console.log(stats)
```

Output:
```javascript
{
  totalGamesPlayed: 2,
  totalScore: 4000,
  highScore: 2500,
  tokensEarned: 40,
  level: 5,
  lifelinesPurchased: 1,
  availableLives: 1
}
```

---

## 📊 How Token Balance is Calculated

**Formula:**
```
Spendable Tokens = tokensEarned - (lifelinesPurchased × 10)
```

**Example:**
- You earned 40 tokens
- You bought 1 lifeline (costs 10 tokens)
- Spendable tokens = 40 - (1 × 10) = 30 tokens

**Why track both?**
- `tokensEarned`: Total tokens ever earned (never decreases)
- `lifelinesPurchased`: How many lives you bought
- `Spendable tokens`: What you can currently spend

---

## 🏆 Level Calculation

**Formula:**
```solidity
level = (totalScore / 1000) + 1
```

**Examples:**
| Total Score | Level |
|-------------|-------|
| 0 - 999 | 1 |
| 1,000 - 1,999 | 2 |
| 2,000 - 2,999 | 3 |
| 5,000 - 5,999 | 6 |
| 10,000 - 10,999 | 11 |

Level increases with **cumulative** score across all games!

## 🚀 Auto-Sync Triggers

Your stats automatically sync in these situations:

1. **On Wallet Connection** (1 second delay)
2. **After Score Submission** (2 second delay)
3. **After Buying Lifeline** (2 second delay)
4. **Manual sync** (`syncBlockchainStats()`)

## 📝 Technical Details

### Files Modified:

1. **`src/utils/hederaHashpack.ts`**
   - Added `getUserStats()` function
   - Fetches all 7 stat fields from contract
   - Converts BigNumber to regular numbers

2. **`public/scripts/walletBridge.js`**
   - Updated `syncBlockchainStats()` to fetch ALL stats
   - Updates coins, high score, games played
   - Updates localStorage and global variables

3. **`src/App.tsx`**
   - Exposed `getUserStats` to wallet bridge
   - Auto-triggers sync on wallet connection

4. **`src/types/global.d.ts`**
   - Added type definitions for `getUserStats`
   - Includes all 7 stat fields

### Smart Contract Function:

```solidity
function getUserStats(address user) external view returns (Stats memory) {
    return userStats[user];
}
```

Returns:
```solidity
struct Stats {
    uint256 totalGamesPlayed;
    uint256 totalScore;
    uint256 highScore;
    uint256 tokensEarned;
    uint256 level;
    uint256 lifelinesPurchased;
    uint256 availableLives;
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Stats still show old local values"
1. Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Reconnect wallet
3. Run `await syncBlockchainStats()`

### "Games played not updating"
- Make sure you **submit** your score after playing
- Check console for "✅ Score submitted successfully"
- Wait 2-3 seconds for auto-sync

### "High score lower than before"
- This is expected! You're on a NEW contract
- Old stats were on the buggy contract
- Play again to rebuild your stats on the working contract

### "Coins showing as negative"
- This shouldn't happen, but if it does:
- It means `lifelinesPurchased × 10 > tokensEarned`
- The sync function should prevent this, showing 0 minimum
