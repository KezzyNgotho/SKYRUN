# Wallet Session Fix - "No matching key" Error

## Problem
Users were getting `Error: No matching key. history: ...` when submitting transactions. The transaction would appear successful in HashPack, but:
1. The error would appear in console
2. Data wasn't being saved to the blockchain

## Root Cause
The error was happening **asynchronously** in HashConnect's WalletConnect relay event handler, AFTER the transaction was sent. This meant:
- Our try-catch blocks couldn't catch it
- Expired WalletConnect sessions weren't being detected before transactions
- The response couldn't be processed due to session key mismatch

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Pre-Flight Session Validation
Before sending any transaction, we now:
```typescript
// Check for expired WalletConnect sessions BEFORE sending
const wcKeys = Object.keys(localStorage).filter(k => k.startsWith('wc@2:'));
wcKeys.forEach(key => {
  const data = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key) || '{}');
  if (data.expiry && data.expiry * 1000 < Date.now()) {
    // Clear expired session
    localStorage.removeItem(key);
    throw new Error('Your wallet session has expired. Please reconnect your wallet and try again.');
  }
});
```

### 2. Global Error Handler
Added a global window error listener to catch async "No matching key" errors:
```typescript
window.addEventListener('error', (event: ErrorEvent) => {
  const message = event.message || event.error?.message || '';
  if (message.includes('No matching key') || 
      message.includes('expirer') ||
      message.includes('topic not found')) {
    // Clear all WalletConnect sessions
    // Alert user
    // Reload page
  }
});
```

### 3. Transaction Verification
Added automatic verification after score submission:
```typescript
// After transaction completes, wait 3 seconds then verify data was saved
setTimeout(async () => {
  const stats = await getUserStats();
  if (stats.totalGamesPlayed === 0) {
    console.error('⚠️ WARNING: Stats show 0 games played! Data may not have been saved.');
    console.error('💡 Possible causes:');
    console.error('   1. Score was 0 (contract reverts on 0 score)');
    console.error('   2. Transaction reverted but showed as "successful"');
    console.error('   3. Reading from wrong contract or wrong account');
  } else {
    console.log('✅ Data successfully saved to blockchain!');
  }
}, 3000);
```

## Files Changed
1. `src/contexts/HashpackContext.tsx`
   - Added pre-flight session validation in `sendTransaction()`
   - Added global error handler for async WalletConnect errors
   - Improved cleanup to remove error listener on unmount

2. `src/utils/hederaHashpack.ts`
   - Added detailed transaction logging in `submitScore()`
   - Added automatic verification after transaction completes

## User Experience
Now when a session expires:
1. **Before sending transaction**: User gets clear error message to reconnect
2. **During async error**: Page automatically reloads with reconnect prompt
3. **After transaction**: Automatic verification confirms data was saved

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Connect wallet and play the game
2. Submit a score (NOT 0)
3. Watch console for detailed logs:
   ```
   🔍 Validating WalletConnect session...
   ✅ Session validation passed
   📤 SUBMITTING SCORE TO BLOCKCHAIN
   📊 Score: 100
   ⏳ Sending transaction to HashPack...
   ✅ TRANSACTION COMPLETED
   🔍 Verifying data was saved...
   ✅ Data successfully saved to blockchain!
   ```

## Known Limitation
- Contract requires score > 0 (reverts on 0)
- Mirror Node indexing takes 2-5 minutes for new contracts
- Session expiry is checked on transaction send, not proactively

## Next Steps
If "No matching key" error still appears:
1. Run `window.clearWalletConnectData()` in console
2. Reconnect wallet
3. Try transaction again

The error should now be **prevented proactively** instead of failing silently! 🎉
