# ✅ FINAL FIX - Mirror Node Contract ID Resolution

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

The 404 error was happening because we were using the **EVM address** (`0x3D047e...`) to query the mirror node, but it needs the **Hedera contract ID** (`0.0.xxxxx`).

### The Solution

I added a helper function that **automatically fetches** the real Hedera contract ID from the mirror node:

```typescript
async function getHederaContractId(evmAddress: string): Promise<string | null> {
  const response = await fetch(`https://testnet.mirrornode.hedera.com/api/v1/contracts/${evmAddress}`);
  if (response.ok) {
    const data = await response.json();
    return data.contract_id; // Returns "0.0.xxxxx"
  }
  return null;
}
```

Then updated all 3 query functions to use it:

1. ✅ `getAvailableLives()` - Now fetches real contract ID first
2. ✅ `getTokenBalance()` - Now fetches real contract ID first
3. ✅ `getUserStats()` - Now fetches real contract ID first

## 🚀 How It Works Now

**Step 1:** Query mirror node for contract info
```
GET /api/v1/contracts/0x3D047e...
→ Returns: { contract_id: "0.0.5033629", ...}
```

**Step 2:** Use that ID to query contract state
```
POST /api/v1/contracts/0.0.5033629/call
→ Returns: Your stats!
```

## 🧪 Test It Now!

**Step 1: Refresh Browser**
```
Ctrl + Shift + R
```

**Step 2: Open Console (F12)**

**Step 3: Connect Wallet**

**Step 4: Run Sync**
```javascript
await syncBlockchainStats()
```

**You should see:**
```
Querying mirror node with contract address: 0.0.5033629
✅ 📊 Blockchain Stats:
  🏆 High Score: [your actual score]
  🎮 Games Played: [your actual games]
  🪙 Tokens: [your actual tokens]
```

## 📊 What You'll See

The console will now log:
```
Querying mirror node with contract address: 0.0.xxxxx
```

This confirms it's using the correct Hedera contract ID!

Then you'll see all your real stats that have been saved on the blockchain all along! 🎉

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Before (404 Error):
```
POST /api/v1/contracts/0x3D047eFea4994106b4A7ad07746a23133c8D30DE/call
→ 404 Not Found (mirror node doesn't recognize EVM address)
```

### After (Working!):
```
1. GET /api/v1/contracts/0x3D047e... 
   → {contract_id: "0.0.5033629"}
   
2. POST /api/v1/contracts/0.0.5033629/call
   → {result: "0x..."}
   
3. Decode result
   → {highScore: 1234, games: 5, tokens: 25}
```

## ✅ Everything Should Work Now!

1. **Refresh** browser
2. **Connect** wallet  
3. **Run** `await syncBlockchainStats()`
4. **See** your real stats! 🎉
