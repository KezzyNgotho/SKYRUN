# 🔗 Blockchain Stats Sync - Complete Guide

## ✅ What We Fixed

Your game now shows **real blockchain tokens** instead of fake local browser coins!

### Before (Confusing):
- **Main Menu Coins:** 1,500 (from browser localStorage) ❌
- **Blockchain Tokens:** 0 (from smart contract) ❌
- **Result:** You couldn't buy lifelines despite seeing coins!

### After (Synced):
- **Main Menu Coins:** Shows your **real blockchain tokens** ✅
- **Blockchain Tokens:** Same as main menu ✅
- **Result:** What you see is what you can spend! 🎉

## 🔄 How Auto-Sync Works

Your UI automatically syncs with blockchain in these situations:

### 1. **When You Connect Your Wallet**
```
Connect Wallet → Wait 1 second → Fetch blockchain stats → Update UI
```

### 2. **After You Submit a Score**
```
Play Game → Submit Score → Wait 2 seconds → Fetch new tokens → Update UI
```

### 3. **After You Buy a Lifeline**
```
Buy Lifeline → Wait 2 seconds → Fetch new balance → Update UI
```

## 🎮 What Gets Synced

| UI Element | Shows |
|------------|-------|
| **Main Menu "Total Coins"** | Your blockchain tokens 🪙 |
| **Store Coins** | Your blockchain tokens 🪙 |
| **myCoins variable** | Your blockchain tokens 🪙 |
| **localStorage['myCoins']** | Your blockchain tokens 🪙 |

All of these now read from the **smart contract** instead of local storage!

## ✅ Testing Steps

### Step 1: Refresh Browser
```
Press: Ctrl + Shift + R (hard refresh)
```

### Step 2: Connect Wallet
- Click "Connect Wallet"
- Approve in HashPack
- **Wait 1-2 seconds** → Your coins will update automatically!

### Step 3: Check Console
Open browser console (F12) and you should see:
```
✅ Wallet connected, syncing blockchain stats...
🔄 Syncing blockchain stats to UI...
📊 Blockchain Stats:
  🪙 Tokens: 0
  ❤️ Lives: 0
✅ Updated mainCoinBlock with blockchain tokens
✅ Blockchain stats synced to UI!
```

### Step 4: Play the Game
- Play and score **1000+ points**
- Submit your score
- **Wait 2-3 seconds** after submission
- Your coins should automatically update to **10 or more**!

### Step 5: Verify Sync
Run in console:
```javascript
await checkGameTokens()
```

You should see:
```
📍 Contract being queried: 0x3D047eFea4994106b4A7ad07746a23133c8D30DE (NEW FIXED CONTRACT)
🪙 Token Balance: 10
❤️ Available Lives: 0
```

And the main menu should show **the same 10 coins**!

## 🛠️ Manual Sync Command

If you ever want to manually refresh your stats, run:

```javascript
await syncBlockchainStats()
```

This will:
1. Fetch your blockchain tokens
2. Fetch your blockchain lives
3. Update all UI elements
4. Update localStorage
5. Update global variables

## 📊 Behind the Scenes

### What Happens When You Connect:

```javascript
1. Wallet connects
2. App.tsx detects connection
3. Calls syncBlockchainStats() after 1 second
4. syncBlockchainStats() calls:
   - getTokenBalance() → Gets tokens from contract
   - getAvailableLives() → Gets lives from contract
5. Updates UI:
   - mainCoinBlock.innerText = tokens
   - storeCoinsText.innerText = tokens
   - localStorage.setItem('myCoins', tokens)
   - window.myCoins = tokens
```

### What Happens After Score Submission:

```javascript
1. You submit score
2. Score goes to blockchain
3. Contract awards tokens
4. After 2 seconds:
   - syncBlockchainStats() runs
   - Fetches new balance
   - Updates UI with new tokens
```

## ⚙️ Technical Details

### Files Modified:

1. **`public/scripts/walletBridge.js`**
   - Added `syncBlockchainStats()` function
   - Modified `callStacksFinalize()` to sync after score submission
   - Modified `callStacksBuyLife()` to sync after purchase

2. **`src/App.tsx`**
   - Added auto-sync on wallet connection
   - Waits 1 second after connection to sync

3. **`src/types/global.d.ts`**
   - Added `syncBlockchainStats` type definition

### Sync Function Logic:

```javascript
async function syncBlockchainStats() {
  // 1. Check if wallet is connected
  if (!connected) return;
  
  // 2. Fetch blockchain data
  const tokens = await getTokenBalance();
  const lives = await getAvailableLives();
  
  // 3. Update ALL UI elements
  mainCoinBlock.innerText = tokens;
  storeCoinsText.innerText = tokens;
  localStorage.setItem('myCoins', tokens);
  window.myCoins = tokens;
  
  // 4. Log success
  console.log('✅ Synced!');
}
```

## 🎯 What This Means for You

### Before:
```
Local Coins (fake): 1,500
Blockchain Tokens (real): 0
Can buy lifelines? NO (contract checks blockchain, not local coins)
```

### After:
```
UI Coins = Blockchain Tokens = 10
Can buy lifelines? YES (if you have 10+ tokens)
No more confusion!
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "UI still shows 0 after playing"
1. Did you wait 2-3 seconds after submitting score?
2. Check console for "✅ Score submitted successfully"
3. Check console for "✅ Blockchain stats synced to UI"
4. Manually run: `await syncBlockchainStats()`

### "UI shows different number than checkGameTokens()"
- Refresh the page (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Reconnect wallet
- Run `await syncBlockchainStats()`

### "Coins aren't updating automatically"
- Make sure you're on the NEW contract (refreshed browser)
- Check console for sync messages
- Verify wallet is still connected
